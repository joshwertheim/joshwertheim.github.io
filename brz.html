            <h3>Slurve</h3>
            <small>The slurve is a baseball pitch in which the pitcher throws a curve ball as if it were a slider. The pitch is gripped like a curve ball, but thrown with a slider velocity. The term is a portmanteau of slider and curve.</small>
            <p>I bought a Subaru BRZ earlier this year, and there is just about nothing that I love more than driving out to the curvy, twisty roads of the Bay Area for some weekend excitement. The BRZ is purpose-built in Japan for expert handling and accuracy while cornering. The car is also known for its ability to slide a bit on the back end (depending on the tires). In a way, the baseball term "Slurve" fits the BRZ perfectly.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite roads in the Bay Area are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hwy 84 West from Sand Hill Rd. to Hwy 1</li>
                <li>Hwy 84 West from Sand Hill Rd. to Pescadero Creek Rd., and further to the town of Pescadero (this is quite the technical drive)</li>
                <li>Hicks Rd. in San Jose</li>
            </ul>
