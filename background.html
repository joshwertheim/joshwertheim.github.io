            <p>While coding, you can usually find me with a set of headphones or speakers playing newly discovered music or even some great classics.</p>

            <p>In my time away from computers, I like to read books, watch some good tv (of which there sadly isn't much left), and take naps because resting is great. Also, I have lately begun to learn the art of homebrewing beer, so I'm in the midst of looking into San Francisco Bay Area microbreweries.</p>
